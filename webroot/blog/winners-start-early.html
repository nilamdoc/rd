<h3>Be a winner begin early tr life would be hurly-burly!</h3>

<p>Let us make this very clear - if we want our dreams to come true, we must wake up, and wake up early! Every hour lost, is the hour we would be chasing the entire day to find, and we will never find that hour ever! Age old wisdom has a paradigm to share – early to bed, early to rise, makes one healthy, wealthy and wise! It seems that many great men and women took this proverb seriously to achieve greatness. All the ancient sages started their day rather early, as did Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, who would wake up early in the morning to plan their activities. Ernest Hemingway claimed that he did his best writing early in the morning. While PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi wakes up 4 am and is at work by 7 am, and General Motors CEO Mary Barra is at work by 6 am. Milkha Sing, the flying Singh was caught by his officers in his regiment doing his rigorous laps in very early hours of morning! It is said that Mozart would start his practice early at 4.00 am. Even Guru Haridas and his great prodigy Tansen, they all started their practice very early in the morning, so much so, Akabar the great was so enamored with Tansen that he too would be rather early in morning to savor the melodious nectar of Tansen's voice.</p>
<p>In the world of the animals the same aphorism applies, and is being echoed till now – it is the early bird that catches the worm. Even lion gets out rather early in morning to hunt and mostly pounces upon a LAZY gazelle, failing which, it may go starving the entire day.
For eons, scientists and spiritualists alike have put their weight behind the benefits of waking up early, as early as the sun even. Those who have borrowed from this wise legacy have gone on to write some of the most well-known success stories of the modern world. On that list are leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma, and Jeff Bezos, and closer home, Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani, among others.
A study conducted by biologist Christoph Randler also authenticated the age-old fact that early risers tend to be more proactive and productive than their evening counterparts. “When it comes to business success, morning people hold the important cards...Morning people also anticipate problems and try to minimize them, my survey showed. They're proactive. A number of studies have linked this trait, proactivity, with better job performance, greater career success, and higher wages,” said Randler.</p>
<p>The inspiration that early start in any activity brings forth is unique, and in modern parlance, exceptionally personalized. Be it a writer, a musician, a teacher, or an entrepreneur, everyone stands to gain from the tenet of starting the day early with a fresh mind. So whether it is a morning run or meditation or just getting some fresh air, starting up early allows you the mental space to de clutter your mind and provide a healthy dose of inspiration to see the day through. Even tycoons such as Tim Cook, Richard Branson, and Indira Nooyi, to name a few, have a dedicated routine routine which they follow religiously.</p><p>The benefits to early starters are many:
<ol>
<li>Good mood.</li>
<li>Attractive situation.</li> 
<li>Better Learning. </li>
<li>Freedom to focus. </li>
<li>Positive culture of mutual respect. </li>
<li>Solid support system. </li>
<li>Better press / media. </li>
<li>Invitations to the best parties. </li>
<li>Self-determination. </li>
<li>Continuity.</li>
<li>Sustainability.</li>
</ol>
<h3>INDEED WINNERS BEGIN EARLY </h3>
<p>But no matter how bad some people want to achieve greatness, they simply do not know how to start early. The most successful achievers in the world use to set up their days for success with an early start. The way you begin your day really determines how you live your day. These early hours are the hours of least distraction when your energy is at its peak, and the good news is you can pick any particular hour from these.</p>
<p>Have it inscribed everywhere in your home, on curtains, dining table kitchen wall, mirrors, porch etc – IF YOU DO NOT START EARLY YOU CAN MAKE PROGRESS IN NOTHING and remember the Senegalese wisdom – THE OPPORTUNITY THAT GOD SENDS DOES NOT WAKE UP HIM WHO IS ASLEEP!  So wake up from your reverie and slumber, and be the first to start on your mission, to reach the destination before others, and continue thus, teaching all – SUCCESS IS A JOURNEY AND NOT A DESTINATION!</p>
