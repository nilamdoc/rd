			<h3>What Each Type Brings to the Relationship</h3>
			<p>As with all double-type relationships, two Enneagram Sevens generally bring the same qualities to each other. Therein lies both a main source of the attraction as well as one of the main pitfalls. Thus, the Level of health of each person is especially important for these types of relationships as are their dominant instincts. The key characteristics of double Seven relationships are easy to spot: high energy, spontaneity, frequent travel and entertaining, and an interest in anything new or that promises to open new possibilities. If both Sevens are psychologically healthy and well balanced, there is a noteworthy joyousness and sense of abundance that permeates their relationship and which spills out to everyone around them. A healthy double Seven relationship is emphatically happy—even radiant and exuberant-and both parties enjoy sharing their happiness with as many others as possible. They are thoughtful, sensitive, idealistic, hospitable, and generous. Double Seven couples are sociable and unusually good company for others as much as they are with each other.</p>
			<p>Each brings to the relationship a spirit of personal freedom that is noteworthy. Neither wants to be tied down in routines or empty, formal commitments, and so both Sevens are determined to not impose many rules or expectations on the other. They want their relationship to be guided by the fact that both parties positively want to be with the other rather than feeling that they are locked into some constricting set of obligations. Both Sevens bring a sense of possibility, open-endedness, experimentalism, and realism that enables them to build a life together—while making it an enjoyable experience for themselves and their circle of family and friends. Double Seven pairings are optimistic and resilient, and always ready to pick themselves up and start over again when they run into difficulties. Gratitude for the relationship—and for finding each other—is the guiding spirit.</p>
			<h3>Potential Trouble Spots or Issues</h3>
			<p>Building a relationship usually takes time spent together, and patience to weather the disappointments and disillusionments that are also usually part of the picture. One of the main problems with double Seven relationships is that of impatience—of wanting the relationship to be more complete and developed than it really is. While double Seven pairings have no lack of energy and high expectations for their relationship, they may find it difficult to stay with both themselves and the other as both work through the growing pains of the relationship. As time goes on and the relationship is no longer the stimulating experience that it once was, Sevens begin to turn their attention elsewhere, possibly to their work or to other involvements.</p>
			<p>Both Sevens feel that somewhere in the world exists the perfect person for them. Sevens are terrified of missing out on whatever in life they are meant to have. They hate the feeling that by committing themselves to one thing-whether it is one person, one place to live, or one career—they are limiting their life in some fundamental way. In short, Sevens tend to be commitment adverse, and it is a measure of their psychological health when they can commit relatively easily and permanently to someone. In a double Seven relationship, this problem is compounded and one of the Sevens must be the first to risk commitment—and possible rejection.</p>
			<p>Another problem for double Seven relationships is that both tend to be impulsive and irreverent, often saying and doing whatever brings relief in the heat of the moment. During arguments things are said which cannot be unsaid, and feelings may be irreparably hurt by either. Both can be insensitive, self-centered, and unreliable. Both tend also to crave constant stimulation which can lead to a hectic social life. This can be exciting if both parties do things together, but if they begin to have separate interests and different sets of friends, their social lives will pull them apart. They may begin to have little time for each other or for their family. Someone is bound to feel left out, and on some level, each Seven is determined that it will not be him.</p>
